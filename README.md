This repository contains some utilities to help quickly create characters for a certain well-known pen and paper roleplaying game (that I won't name for trademark reasons.)  It is *very incomplete*, being:

- a character-build library `npc`, populated with character classes as and when I want them for my campaign
- a command line program `npcconsole` to create characters interactively on the console
- hopefully some more projects soon to make a Web version of this.

The rules of the roleplaying game in question are available under the Open Gaming License.  The rest of the code is copyright myself and I'll slap a license file in here at some point.
